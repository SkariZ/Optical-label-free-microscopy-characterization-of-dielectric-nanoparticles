# Optical-label-free-microscopy-characterization-of-dielectric-nanoparticles

By Berenice García Rodríguez, Erik Olsén, Fredrik Skärberg, Daniel Midtvedt, Fredrik Höök and Giovanni Volpe



## Description
 Here, we explore the relationship between particle properties and function through fast and detailed particle characterization techniques, focusing on nano-submicron particles.

In this tutorial, we provide three notebooks focusing on particle characterization techniques: brightfield microscopy, darkfield microscopy, and ISCATY (Interferometric Scattering Microscopy).
